<h1>Round Robin Page Replacement Algorithm - Input Information</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>The Round Robin page replacement algorithm allocates a fixed time quantum to each process before moving to the next. This ensures fair CPU scheduling and is suitable for scenarios with varying burst times.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total number of processes in the system:</strong> 4</li>
<li><strong>Arrival and Burst times:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Process[1]: Arrival time = 0, Burst time = 5</li>
<li>Process[2]: Arrival time = 1, Burst time = 3</li>
<li>Process[3]: Arrival time = 2, Burst time = 6</li>
<li>Process[4]: Arrival time = 3, Burst time = 4</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Time Quantum:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<h3>Round Robin is effective in scenarios where processes have varying burst times, there is a need for fair CPU time allocation, and preemptive scheduling is required.</h3>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prevents starvation by ensuring each process gets CPU time.</li>
<li>Simple implementation with fixed time slices.</li>
<li>Handles varying burst times efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3>Round Robin page replacement algorithm is commonly used in operating system CPU scheduling, network packet scheduling, and simulations requiring fair allocation of resources.</h3>
